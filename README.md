Simulation of swimming pool operation  We wish to model the operation of a swimming pool where the behaviour of each swimmer is represented by a Swimmer task (Swimmer class provided) associated with a synchronisation to protect access to the baskets and dressing or undressing cabins. It is assumed that the total number of places in the pool is limited to the number of baskets and that the number of cabins is less than the number of baskets. A swimmer, who comes to the pool, successively asks for a basket and a cabin, undresses, then frees the cabin, but not the basket containing his clothes. When the he asks for a cabin again, gets dressed and then frees the cabin and the basket which is now empty.
